"""
    count_flops(A::Matrix,B::Matrix)

Counts the total number of floating point operations, including mod.
According to GFlops, Julia's mod operation takes only 1 flop.
This is adjustable through the variable MOD_OPS.

    # Each element takes n multiplications and n-1 additions
    # There are mk total number of elements
    return m * k * (2n - 1)
end

"""
    count_Flops(A::Matrix,B::Matrix,TILE_WIDTH,MAX_OPS)

Counts the total number of floating point operations, excluding mod.
